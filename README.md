Java Editions Comparison Java ME (Micro Edition) ‚Ä¢ Designed for small devices like feature phones, IoT devices, smart cards, TVs, and embedded systems. ‚Ä¢ Provides lightweight configurations such as CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration) and MIDP (Mobile Information Device Profile). ‚Ä¢ Uses a compact Java ME Virtual Machine (KVM/CLDC HotSpot) to run on resource-constrained hardware. ‚Ä¢ Suitable for mobile games, IoT controllers, and simple device apps. ‚Ä¢ Optimized for low memory and low CPU power. Java SE (Standard Edition) ‚Ä¢ The core Java platform and foundation for all other editions. ‚Ä¢ Targets desktop, laptop, and small client-server applications. ‚Ä¢ Includes core APIs: Collections Framework, Streams, JDBC, NIO, Networking, Swing/JavaFX, and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). ‚Ä¢ Used for standalone desktop applications, small-scale web servers, and learning Java fundamentals. ‚Ä¢ Forms the base for both Java ME and Java EE. Java EE (Enterprise Edition) (now Jakarta EE) ‚Ä¢ Built on top of Java SE for large-scale, distributed, enterprise applications. ‚Ä¢ Provides additional APIs such as Servlets, JSP, EJB, JPA, JMS, JAX-RS, WebSocket, and more. ‚Ä¢ Runs on an application server (e.g., GlassFish, WildFly, Payara) to support multi-tier architectures. ‚Ä¢ Ideal for high-performance web apps, cloud applications, e-commerce, and banking systems. ‚Ä¢ Handles transaction management, security, and scalability for mission-critical systems.

Quick Summary ‚Ä¢ Java ME ‚Üí Lightweight and optimized for mobile/embedded devices. ‚Ä¢ Java SE ‚Üí The core Java platform for desktop and general-purpose development. ‚Ä¢ Java EE ‚Üí Enterprise-grade platform for server-side, distributed, and cloud applications. JDK vs JRE vs JVM JVM (Java Virtual Machine) ‚Ä¢ What it is: A virtual machine that runs Java bytecode. ‚Ä¢ Role: Converts compiled bytecode (.class files) into machine code for the host operating system. ‚Ä¢ Key Feature: Provides platform independence ‚Äì ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anywhere‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Includes: Class loader, bytecode verifier, JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, and garbage collector. ‚Ä¢ Developer/End User: Needed by both developers and end-users to run Java programs.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) ‚Ä¢ What it is: A runtime package that provides all the libraries and the JVM needed to run Java applications. ‚Ä¢ Role: Allows you to run Java programs but cannot compile them. ‚Ä¢ Includes: JVM + core libraries (collections, networking, I/O, etc.) + supporting files. ‚Ä¢ Developer/End User: Suitable for end-users who just need to run Java apps.

JDK (Java Development Kit) ‚Ä¢ What it is: A full software development kit required to develop and run Java programs. ‚Ä¢ Role: Provides everything in the JRE plus development tools to compile and debug code. ‚Ä¢ Includes: JRE + compiler (javac) + debugger + tools like jar, javadoc. ‚Ä¢ Developer/End User: Required for developers to write and compile Java code.

Syllabus Topic ‚Üí Project Mapping
Syllabus Topic Where It‚Äôs Demonstrated (File / Class / Method) Explanation OOP ‚Äì Classes & Objects Student.java, Course.java, EnrollmentManager.java Core entities are modeled as Java classes with fields, constructors, and methods. Encapsulation (Getters/Setters) Student.java (getId(), setEmail(), etc.) Private fields with public getters/setters to protect data. Inheritance & Polymorphism Transcript printing via toString() in Student.java and Course.java Overridden toString() methods provide polymorphic string output. Abstraction (Interfaces/Enums) Semester.java (enum), Grade.java (enum) Enums abstract semester and grade logic. Collections Framework StudentManager.java (List students), CourseManager.java (List courses) Uses ArrayList to store and manage data. Stream API & Lambda CourseManager.java ‚Üí searchByInstructor(), filterByDepartment(), filterBySemester() Uses Streams and lambda expressions for filtering/searching. Date/Time API Student.java (LocalDate dob, enrollmentDate), FileOperations.java Uses java.time.LocalDate for student DOB and timestamps. Enums Semester.java, Grade.java Strongly typed constants for semesters and letter grades. Exception Handling FileOperations.java (try-catch in importStudents(), importCourses()) Handles IOException while reading CSV files. File I/O (NIO.2) FileOperations.java (Files.lines(), Path, Files.copy()) Demonstrates Files, Path, and Streams for import/export/backup. CLI / Console I/O MasterCLI.java (menu loop, switch) Menu-driven console with Scanner, loops, and switch statements. Decision Making MasterCLI.java (switch cases), EnrollmentManager.java (if-else checks for max credits) Conditional logic for user choices and enrollment rules. Loops MasterCLI.java (while loop for menu), StudentManager.java (enhanced-for loop to list students) Demonstrates while, for, and enhanced-for loops. Break / Continue / Labeled Jump MasterCLI.java inside menu navigation Shows break and continue in menu-driven logic. Generics List, List in all manager classes Uses generic collections for type-safe data storage. Static Members GradeCalculator.java (static methods to compute GPA) Provides utility methods without needing object creation. Package Management package java_project; in every class Organizes code into a single logical package. JDK/JRE/JVM Project compilation & execution process Demonstrated during project build (javac ‚Üí bytecode ‚Üí JVM execution). JavaFX / GUI (Optional) (Not applicable) This project is console-based, but could be extended to GUI later.

Assertions in Java ‚Ä¢ Assertions are used to test assumptions during runtime. ‚Ä¢ They help in debugging and catching programming errors early. ‚Ä¢ If the assertion condition is false, the JVM throws an AssertionError. ‚Ä¢ Assertions are disabled by default at runtime. Example: int age = -5; assert age >= 0 : "Age cannot be negative!";

Enabling Assertions By default, running a Java program with: java MyClass will not evaluate assertions. You must explicitly enable them using: ‚Ä¢ -ea ‚Üí enable assertions ‚Ä¢ -da ‚Üí disable assertions ‚Ä¢ -esa ‚Üí enable assertions in system classes (rarely needed)

Sample Commands

Compile the Program javac MyClass.java This creates MyClass.class (bytecode).
Run With Assertions Enabled java -ea MyClass or, to enable assertions only in a specific package/class: java -ea:java_project... MyClass (Replace java_project with your package name)
Disable Assertions (Default) java -da MyClass
Enable Assertions for System Classes (Used if you want to check JDK internal classes too) java -esa MyClass
Project Example If your main class is MasterCLI inside the java_project package: javac java_project/MasterCLI.java java -ea java_project.MasterCLI

Tips ‚Ä¢ Use assert for development/testing, not for production validation (use exceptions instead). ‚Ä¢ Assertions can be selectively enabled per class or per package, which is useful for large projects. ‚Ä¢ You can combine options: java -ea:java_project... -da:java_project.test... java_project.MasterCLI This enables assertions for all classes in java_project but disables them in java_project.test.
